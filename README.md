# Makbinding Formatting Guide

This guide is meant as a brief description of the template used in the Makbinding books
The elements described below roughly correspond to the template's formatting elements.

# Word Template Details

## Rythm

15pt
The rythm of the book is defined by the line height, so that all page elements align with each other accross the 2 pages. 

## Margins
All margins are defined at 1.8cm. The default gutter is 5mm, but it is advised to change it based on the thickness and binding of the book.

## Font

Font: 11pt Garamond

## Paragraph

Identation is 0.5cm on the first line. No margins before or after the paragraph.

## Header, Title

The font is 30pt with a 30pt line height. Margins are 30pt before and after the header. This is meant to be used in Chapters, as the header will be included in the Table of Contents.
The Title element is identical, but does not appear in the table of contents. USeful for example for the book front page or general purpose titles.

# Book Binding Detailes

The prefered method of binding is sewn and the page size is usually A5 just because of the easy availability of A4 paper. If you want proper paper grain, then the easiest way to get quality paper is probably to get A3 sheets and cut them (not in half)

The suggested dimensions are
4mm square
12mm hinge
218mm x 142mm covers
