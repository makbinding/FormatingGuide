# Makbinding Formatting Guide

This guide is meant as a brief description of the template used in the Makbinding books. The elements described below roughly correspond to the template's formatting elements.

# Word Template Details

## Rythm

The rythm of the book is defined by the line spacing (at least 15pt). This allows all page elements to align with each other accross pages, as long as their heigth and margins are a multiple of the line spacing. 
You need to pay attention to images. They should be kept inline to avoid moving them outside of the line spacing grid. Their height is in cm, but you can manually define it in pt and the application will automatically  translate it to cm.

## Margins
- All margins are defined at 1.8cm. 
- The default gutter is 5mm, but you should change it based on the thickness and binding of the book.

## Font

- 11pt Garamond
- 30pt Goody Old Style

## Paragraph

- Identation is 0.5cm on the first line. 
- No margins before or after the paragraph.

## Header, Title

- The font is 30pt with a 30pt line height. 
- Margins are 30pt before and after the header. This is meant to be used in Chapters, as the header will be included in the Table of Contents.
- The Title element is identical, but does not appear in the table of contents. Useful for example for the book front page or general purpose titles.
- You can select a page break before each header
- Header 2 is 15pt with 15pt line spacing. Subtitle is the same but does not appear to Table of Contents.

# Book Binding Details

The prefered method is sewn case binding. The page size is A5 just because of the easy availability of A4 paper. If you want proper paper grain, then the easiest way to get quality paper is probably to get A3 sheets and cut them (not in half)

The suggested dimensions are
- 16 page signatures (adjust according to the required swell)
- 4mm square
- 10mm hinge (8mm + thickness)
- Cover boards:
  - 210 + 2 x square = 218mm height
  - 148 + square - hinge = 142mm width
  - 2mm thickness (suggested to use 1mm if less than 100 pages)
